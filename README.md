# hbwater_cameratrap_pheno
Aquatic camera trap photos for HB Water

## Project Steps 
1. image data re-organization 
2. ROI  
3. project host - GDrive? Server?
4. created inverted masked images
5. classify pixels in image using image annotator 
6. run random forest model
7. create data product: markdown
8. create data product: application

## notes
while the above steps are roughly in order, we will be working on certain aspects of the project throughout, such as:
  - keeping all code well-documented and clean
  - creating Jupyter notebooks for each script with embedded markdown/html that explains each step of the script

## Current Objectives
Tasks | People | Step
------- | -------- | --------
figure out how to show mask on consecutive images (clicking thru all the images from a particular watershed year) | XX | **1**
allow user to, while clicking through images, stop and create a new mask associated with the date of that image  | XX | **2**
continue debugging the GDrive image copy/rename/organization scripts  | XX | **2**
organize the GitHub repo (remove uneeded scripts and standardize naming conventions, etc.)   | XX | **2**
figure out our file hosting options: server, google drive, local files, etc.   | AT + WS | **2**


## Future Objectives
Tasks | People | Step
------- | -------- | --------
create walkthrough with example files as both proof-of-concept for our data pipeline, and as a walkthrough for future users | XX | **1**
export Jupyter notebook to *.py* files  | XX | **2**
